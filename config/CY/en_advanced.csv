ui.title, Satellite Builder
ui.introduction, <p>The UK Space Agency is planning its next satellite mission. They've asked you to help design it!</p><p>Your role is to design and launch a satellite that can perform a specific role related to communications, navigation or earth observation. You’ll need to select the size of your satellite along with its instruments and power supply. Once it’s completed, you’ll need to design a rocket capable of launching your satellite into orbit — will you succeed?</p>
